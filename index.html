        <h1>Sorceress stat priorities are Critical and Swiftness. Because this build uses a lot of critical damage tripods, 
            its very important to be as consistent with critical hits as possible. Lower Swiftness can easily be made up for by having your identity Blink on-hand for emergency situations.
            Swiftness stacking can also work if you choose to proceed with the alternative build.
